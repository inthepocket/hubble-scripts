# Prerequisites

- macOS with Sketch 41+ (latest Sketch recommended)
- A recent bash version (bash@4.4 recommended)
- A recent node version (node@8 recommended)

# Usage

> There is a sample sketchfile in the [__mocks__](./__mocks__) folder with sample output that would be generated for this file.

## Generating JSON config

This will generate a `hubble-data.json` file with text styles & colors found in a Sketch document.
Works best with a library file.

```bash
bash ./hubble.sh "/home/usr/file.sketch"
```

You can optionally specify a config output dir as $2 and asset output dir as $3. Otherwise current working directory will be used:

```bash
bash ./hubble.sh "/home/usr/file.sketch" "/var/hubble" "/var/hubble/assets/images"
```

## Exporting assets

Will export all assets as SVG (for web) and PNG (1x, 2x, 3x for native).
Works best with a library file.

```bash
bash ./sketchtool.sh "MyFile.sketch" "/var/hubble/assets/images"
```

## Uploading to cloud

There are scripts to upload your files to AWS S3 and to Google Cloud.
It is assumed that you have [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) cli already installed and configured.

Each script takes 3 arguments
1) Assets output folder
2) Configuration output folder
3) Bucket name

You can configure this service by adding one of these lines to `hubble.sh`

`upload_to_gcloud "$ASSETS_OUTPUT_DIR" "$CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIR" "$1"`

`upload_to_s3 "$ASSETS_OUTPUT_DIR" "$CONFIG_OUTPUT_DIR" "$1"`

# Integrations

## Importing into a project

Copy `hubble.sh` and `sketchtool.sh` to a scripts folder in your project
Advised is to add a npm run task for this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "hubble": "./scripts/hubble.sh"
  }
}
```

# Development

## Building the binary

hubble-scripts has to option to compile down to a binary that can be used on 64-bit macOS systems. This functionality is provided so it can be used in other native applications or systems where the Node.js runtime is not available.
Since Node provides no option to build a binary and relies on the runtime itself, we are using `zeit/pkg` to do this for us. The only downside is that the binary is large in size.

> Important!: before building, make sure you bump the version in package.json if required since it will compile down with the binary and the --version flag on the binary uses this file to return version output.

```console
# Verify that your version is correct first
$ grep "version" package.json
> "version": "3.0.0",

# Build the application down to a binary in the bin folder
$ npm run build
> pkg cli.js -t node8-macos-x64 --output ./bin/hubble-cli

# Verify it's ok
$ bin/hubble-cli --version
> 3.1.0
```

# Testing

This project uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to run tests. You can trigger the tests with `npm test`.

## Mocks & sample output

All tests will be validated against the sample output in [__mocks__](./__mocks__). You can regenerate these using `npm run generate:mocks` which will consume `__mocks__/sample_sketchfile.sketch` and output a new config & sketch2json dump.

## Local CI server mocking

If you have Docker installed you could use [trevor](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/trevor) to locally mock our Travis CI server before submitting a pull request or while testing a new change. It will pull a node@8:alpine image from Docker Hub and run tests inside of the container, and afterwards destroy the container.

## Bash

[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is used to ensure consistent and safe shell (bash) scripts. Make sure you have shellcheck installed and run the lint command to test the scripts:

```console
$ brew install shellcheck
$ npm run lint:shell

In hubble.sh line 6:
  printf "\n\\033[1m\\033[34m%s\\033[0m\\n\\n" "[hubble-scripts] ${1}"
          ^-- SC1117: Backslash is literal in "\n". Prefer explicit escaping: "\\n".

```
